A Lua/C event-based development framework on top of the Android Kernel. 

The system is compiled with all the necessary libraries (i.e. glibc, SDL, libeio, libev, libpng etc.) in such a way that written applications make no use of the Android (Java/NDK) system.

The idea (in the end) is to build a full Operating System in Lua/C. This way the apps can be written mostly in Lua and the performance/critical sections can be written in native C/C++.
